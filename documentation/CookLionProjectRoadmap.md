# Cook Lion - Project Roadmap

## Product Overview

Cook Lion is a comprehensive cooking recipe management web application designed as a learning project to explore production-grade software deployment and architecture patterns. The application serves as both a functional recipe management system and a practical exploration of modern web development, DevOps, and production deployment techniques.

### Core Features
- **Recipe Management**: Save, organize, and manage cooking recipes
- **Shuffle Mode**: AI-powered weekly meal planning with automatic grocery list generation
- **AI Recipe Assistant**: Intelligent recipe creation from simple ingredient descriptions
- **User Authentication**: Secure login/logout with JWT-based authorization
- **File Management**: Authenticated access to recipe images and attachments

### Technology Learning Goals
- Production-ready Spring Boot application architecture
- Modern frontend with server-side rendering (Thymeleaf + Tailwind CSS)
- Authentication & authorization patterns
- Database optimization and caching strategies
- Load balancing and performance testing
- Container orchestration and deployment
- Production monitoring and observability

## Architecture Overview

### Core Technologies
- **Backend**: Java 24, Spring Boot 3.5.4, Spring AI
- **Frontend**: Thymeleaf, Tailwind CSS, Webpack, Component Library (ShadUI-inspired)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with refresh token rotation
- **Caching**: Redis for session storage and/or application caching
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose â†’ Kubernetes
- **Deployment**: Hetzner VPS with custom domain

## Learning Objectives & Success Metrics

### Technical Skills Development
- **Spring Boot Mastery**: Production-ready configuration and architecture
- **Database Performance**: Understanding JPA vs JDBC trade-offs
- **Authentication Patterns**: JWT implementation and security best practices
- **Caching Strategies**: Redis integration and optimization
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker and Kubernetes proficiency
- **Production Deployment**: VPS management and deployment automation

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Response Time**: < 200ms for 95th percentile
- **Throughput**: Support 1000+ concurrent users
- **Database Performance**: Optimize for 10,000+ recipes with complex queries
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability in production
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities in security audit

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database Performance**: Mitigate with proper indexing and caching
- **Authentication Security**: Regular security audits and token rotation
- **Deployment Complexity**: Gradual migration from Docker to Kubernetes
- **Resource Constraints**: Monitor and optimize resource usage continuously

### Learning Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to defined phases and learning objectives
- **Technology Overload**: Focus on one technology at a time
- **Production Issues**: Comprehensive testing and monitoring setup

## Documentation Strategy

- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger for all endpoints
- **Architecture Decisions**: ADR (Architecture Decision Records) for major decisions
- **Deployment Guides**: Step-by-step deployment documentation
- **Performance Reports**: Regular performance benchmarking reports
- **Lessons Learned**: Document challenges and solutions for future reference
